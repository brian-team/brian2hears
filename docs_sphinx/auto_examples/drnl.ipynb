        "\n# Dual resonance nonlinear filter (DRNL)\nImplementation example of the dual resonance nonlinear (DRNL) filter with\nparameters fitted for human as described in Lopez-Paveda, E. and Meddis, R., A\nhuman nonlinear cochlear filterbank, JASA 2001.\n\nA class called :class:`~brian2hears.DRNL` implementing this model is available\nin the library.\n\nThe entire pathway consists of the sum of a linear and a nonlinear pathway.\n\nThe linear path consists of a bank of bandpass filters (second order gammatone),\na low pass function, and a gain/attenuation factor, g, in a cascade.\n\nThe nonlinear path is  a cascade consisting of a bank of gammatone filters, a\ncompression function, a second bank of gammatone filters, and a low\npass function, in that order.\n\nThe parameters are given in the form ``10**(p0+mlog10(cf))``.\n"
