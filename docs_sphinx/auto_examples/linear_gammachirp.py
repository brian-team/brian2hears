Linear Gammachirp filters
-------------------------
Example of the use of the class :class:`~brian2hears.LinearGammachirp` available
in the library. It implements a filterbank of FIR gammatone filters with linear
frequency sweeps as described in Wagner et al. 2009, "Auditory responses in the
barn owl's nucleus laminaris to clicks: impulse response and signal analysis of
neurophonic potential", J. Neurophysiol. In this example, a white noise is
filtered by a gammachirp filterbank and the resulting cochleogram is plotted.
The different impulse responses are also plotted.
