'''
Time varying filter (1)
-----------------------
This example implements a band pass filter whose center frequency is modulated
by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck. The white noise term used for this process is output
by a FunctionFilterbank. The bandpass filter coefficients update is an example
of how to use a :class:`~brian2hears.ControlFilterbank`. The bandpass filter is
a basic biquadratic filter for which the Q factor and the center frequency must
be given. The input is a white noise.
