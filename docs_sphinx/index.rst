Brian hears (for Brian 2) is an auditory modelling library for Python. It is built as an extension to the
neural network simulator package Brian 2, but can also be used on its own.

Note that this is a direct update of the original Brian hears package for Brian 1.
Some features available in Brian 2 will not work with this package, see :ref:`Update for Brian 2`.
