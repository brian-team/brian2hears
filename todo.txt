Modules to go through:

- filtering package
    (- gpulinearfilterbank)
    (- gputools)

Other things to do:

- installer
- python 3 support
- cython linear filterbank
- filterbankgroup
    - sort of works, but presumably not with multiple runs and store/restore yet

Examples to fix:

- tan_carney_2003/tan_carney_simple_test (needs re-runs on filterbankgroup done)
