Modules to go through:

- filtering package
    (- gpulinearfilterbank)
    (- gputools)

Other things to do:

- filterbankgroup
    - sort of works, but presumably not with multiple runs and store/restore yet
- distribution (pypi, conda, etc.)
- updated documentation (readthedocs)
    - mention the slice() thing on Python 2

Examples to fix:

- tan_carney_2003/tan_carney_simple_test (needs re-runs on filterbankgroup done)
